**Nadia Wrotecka Interiors** is a responsive portfolio website primarily built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with the purpose of **creating an accessible and engaging online presence for a client**, who offers residential interior design services to their customers.

The target audience of this website is **potential freelance clients**, and also **prospecting employers**, looking to engage with the designer's work through their portfolio.

This project hopes to accomplish a **higher rate of interest** from the target audience, **increasing the designer's client base** or **employment prospects**.

The site will serve as a **central hub** that invites visitors to **learn about the designer's background**, **explore her design work**, and easily be able to **contact her for inquiries**.

I chose this project as my partner is a freelance interior designer with a genuine need for an online presence for her business. Taking on a project with **real world value** for someone important to me provides me the opportunity to challenge myself and push my skills.

## UX

### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy

**Purpose**:
- Establish an online presence for the designer, reflecting her work and personality in an engaging way.
- Increase the visibility of the designer's work and creative identity.
- Develop a platform that showcases her skills and can be easily accessed across multiple devices.

**Primary User Needs**:
- Learn about the designer and her background.
- View their creative work, and explore their projects.

**Business Goals**:
- Generate legitimate interest in the designer's services.
- Increase freelance client base, and employment prospects.

#### 2. Scope

**Features**:
- (see a breakdown here: [Features](#features))

**Content Requirements**:
- Striking header that clearly informs the visitor of the site's purpose.
- High quality images that illustrate the designer's skills.
- Section that provides more information where the user can learn about the designer.
- Form which can be used to get in touch with the designer about her services.
- Responsive website that works seamlessly across devices.

#### 3. Structure

**Information Architecture**:
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Accessible links in the navbar.
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Clear call-to-action buttons.
  - Prominent placement of social media links in the footer.

**User Flow**:
1. User lands on the home page → learns about the designer's style through a large featured image.
2. Navigates to the about section → understands about their background and experience.
3. Views their portfolio of work → engages with links to learn more about specific projects.
4. Contacts the designer through the contact form, inquiring about their services or work.
5. Further engages with the designer on her social media platforms.

#### 4. Skeleton

**Wireframes**:
- (see illustrations here: [Wireframes](#wireframes))

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**:
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** (see below)
- **[Typography](#typography)** (see below)


### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/34312d-57544c-f0e7d8-f6f6f8-581908) to generate my color palette.

- `#34312D` Jet - primary text.
- `#57544C` Walnut Brown - secondary text.
- `#F0E7D8` Antique White - primary background / highlights.
- `#F6F6F8` Anti-flash White - secondary backgorund / highlights.
- `#581908` Seal Brown - main accent.

![screenshot](documentation/colour-palette.png) 

The rationale behind this colour scheme was determined by the brief: the main purpose behind the site is to showcase the designer's work in its best light. Therefore, choosing a neutral and balanced colour palette that compliments the designer's work was crucial.

I chose some warm off whites for the background, complimented with some warm blacks for the text. These neutral tones compliment the sample of images that I have been provided with by the client, and the seal brown accent colour helps tie in the portfolio images with the rest of the site, allowing for a cohesive design.


### Typography

I sourced my fonts from both **Google Fonts** and **Adobe Fonts**, and used **FontPair** to find an effective font pairing. A combination of a serif font with a sans-serif font was used to create a gentle contrast between the title and body elements. The serif font, **Lora**, was used to give the portfolio a curated feel to reflect the personality of the website, and the designer.

To reflect the designer's creative identity, **FontAwesome** icons were integrated as visual cues, reinforcing the site's emphasis on clarity and visual design.

- [Lora](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/lora) was used for the primary headers and titles, taken from [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts).
![screenshot](documentation/fonts/font-sample-lora.png)

- [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope) was used for all other body text, taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
![screenshot](documentation/fonts/font-sample-manrope.png)

- [FontPair](https://www.fontpair.co/pairings/manrope-lora) was used to find a cohesive set of fonts that compliment one another.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.


## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) was used to design the wireframes for this site. The full file can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/design/5wzjNNIanay33PBcxIJdiu/nw-interiors-wireframes?node-id=0-1&t=3WIsrVRLXakJtyCU-1).

## Features
### Existing Features
| Feature | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navbar | Featured on all three pages, the fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home section, About section, Portfolio section, and Contact section, and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. On smaller screens, a burger icon is used to toggle the navbar so it doesn't take up too much space. This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page or section to section across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the "back" button. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/navbar.png) |
| Hero Image | The landing includes a photo that immediately conveys the designer's style, which fills the screen and adapts the image composition based on the screen size of the device. A call to action is overlayed on top of the image, encouraging exploration, with an animated down arrow to demonstrate to users which action to take. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/hero.png) |
| About section | This section provides a background of the designer where the user can learn more about the designer's experience and education. It contains a tagline that summarises what the designer and site is about in just a few words, allowing the user to grasp the purpose of the site quickly. A list of keywords, illustrated with icons, also further elaborate on the designer's style and personality. This provides background information to the reader in various formats, suitable for skim-reading, or detailed exploration, depending on the user. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/about.png) |
| Portfolio section | The main portfolio gallery is the heart of the site. Adaptive to the device screen size so there is no stretching or skewing, it utilises as much of the space as possible to display the designer's work. Each project has a hero image, with further details about the project listed below, including a link that opens the project in a new tab. The portfolio projects change their order, and image, to respond to different screen widths in order to capture the project in the most effective and engaging format. On mobile devices, vertical images are used, and some of these change to landscape images on larger screen widths in order to most effectively make use of the user's device. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/portfolio-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/features/portfolio-2.png) |
| Contact form | Users are able to get in touch with the designer through the contact form, requiring them to input their Name, Email, Inquiry type, and Message into the form in order to submit. Optionally, they can also add their phone numnber to the form, which uses a regex forumula to allow the user to include their area code. On mobile devices, the supporting image is hidden in order to keep the user's focus completely on entering their details, whilst on larger screens, an image sits alongside the form in order to utilise the deadspace whilst keeping the form to a suitable size for the user. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/contact.png) |
| Footer | The footer sits below the contact form and includes links to the relevant social media sites for *Nadia Wrotecka Interiors*. The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The footer is valuable to the user, as it encourages them to keep connected via social media, whilst also providing more contact information about the business. A link to the developer's GitHub is also included, which opens ina  new tab, should the user wish to find out more about the design of the site. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/footer.png) |
| Success page | The confirmation page will give the illusion that the contact form was submitted successfully to the *Nadia Wrotecka Interiors*, confirming their input. Due to the lack of a database or email system so far, this is a fake confirmation page, and the user can navigate back to the main site through the navbar or button. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/success.png) |
| 404 page | The 404 error page will indicate when a user has somehow navigated to a page that doesn't exist. This replaces the default GitHub Pages 404 page, and ties-in with the look and feel of the *Nadia Wrotecka Interiors* site by using the standard navbar and footer. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/error404.png) |

### Future Features

- **Projects Page**: An in-depth exploration of work seen in the Portfolio section. Containing further project details, moodboards, and a breakdown of the designer's process. This would be very useful for potential employers in understanding the designer's workflow.

- **Services Page**: A page that provides a breakdown of the design services provided by *Nadia Wrotecka Interiors*, including pricing and examples. Potential freelance clients would find this helpful when contacting about pitching projects.

- **Services FAQ**: A section found alongside the contact form, and services page, containing a list of frequent questions. Answering basic common questions before a potential client has to get in touch improves the experience of these particular users, whilst saving the designer time.

- **Calendar Appointment Booking**: Providing the user with an option to book a consultation through a live calendar provides them with more agency, as they do not have to wait for a response from their submitted form, instead they can take an action that has a definite outcome. The aim of this feature would be to increase the conversion rate of inquiries.

- **Testamonials**: Including a testamonials section increases the creditibility of the designer, establishing a greater level of trust between her and new users.

- **Designer Blog**: A blog section builds a greater presence of personality within the site, allowing the designer to post her thoughts, ideas, and personal work for users to explore. Interested users can learn more about the designer's creative process and rationale.

- **Inspiraiton Boards**: Building on the blog, inspiration boards would feature images, moodboards, and ideas related to upcoming trends. This could be useful for potential clients, but also a starting place for a creative community to be establishes on the site. It would be encouraged to share these on social media, building the designer's visibility and userbase.

- **Favourites Catalog**: Expanding on the inspiration board, in-trend items could be curated and featured on the site, opening up opportunities for the designer to pursue relationships with suppliers.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects
[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/SADGHOBLIN/nw-interiors-m1/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/SADGHOBLIN/nw-interiors-m1/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

### MoSCoW Prioritisation

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritising and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritisation and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features
